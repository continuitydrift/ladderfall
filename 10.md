# 10: The Creature

*Well*, Eph thought, *this is how I'm going to die*.

He had that feeling behind his eyes, neither pain nor pleasure, or both of them, light so dark that it became a color seen with some unsuspected sense. Eph had felt it only once before, when he woke up after the rock-sledding accident. It was as if the micro-meteor that had punched through his skull and lodged into the soft tissues of his brain had also stitched a pin-sized hole in previous categories of experience, letting in a dark, heavy light of something entirely new. It was the closest he had ever come to a religious experience, although instead of leaving him with a conviction of God, there was just an alien parasite. Not an omniscienct diety, but a conscious being as lost and confused as he was, using the words it found in Eph's brain to express things for which they only crude analogies. *I am a ghost*, it had told him. *An algorithm. A fiction.*

He'd forgotten that feeling, that sense of too-muchness, of over-loaded otherness, until now, sliding down the saliva-sprayed sand, raising the crowbar.

"Wait!" Debria said, as he was about to swing. The four claws of the beast shot out, but not towards Eph. instead, two of the pinchers pushed off the side of the tunnel, while the opposite pair dug into the other wall, hugging ts bulk close tot he sand and rolling up onto one side. Then, Eph saw with fascinated horror, it slid back down until it was rotated 90 degrees from its original orientation, but the claws, and nine concentric eyes behind them, looked the same. The animal had quadrilateral symmetry, the extrusions he had assumed were some kind of thick antannae were actually legs. The protrusions on the top, bottom and sides of the sentral cluster of eyes, were beak-like mouths, opening and closing independently, tongues like probiscises snaking out and tasting the vacuum. The thing skittered up the side again, toppling over, upside-down from is original position but still, maddeningly, the same.

Eph swung the crowbar in front of its face, trying to keep distance bewteen them. The eyes stared at him unblinkingly, beaks and claws clacking. 

"Stop!" Debria called from behind him. "I don't think it wants to hurt us!" Their flashlight beams played across different parts of its body, revealing new horrors: bits of hair, scales, and nudules leaking slime.

"Why else would it get this close?" Eph asked, out. 

"It shouldn't be here," Debria said. "There's no atmosphere. No life. Nothing for it to hunt."

"Well, it obviously..." Eph, backing away from the thing, lost his footing, and fell. with uncanny speed, the monster corkscrewed itself up and around the side of the tunnel while crawling forward, dropping down on Eph from above.

Debria screame, firing the utility laser directly at the cluster of eyes. The weapon had no effect, except a whisp of smoke rising from the ocular membrane. 

The hindquarters of the monster shot upwards, punching into the top of the tunnel, until the full weight of the thing was directly above him, one of the front pinchers holding each of his limbs, the eyes staring down with their terrible symmetry. Debria ran up up to him, wrapping her arms around his chest, trying to pull him free. The she went out of his field of vision, reappearing with the crowbar, to smash it against the legs and eyes of the beast, to no effect.

The four mouths opened, tongues unfurling, probing outward, finding the seams in the neck and wrists of the suit.

The read-out on the bottom of the face plate, always displaying environmental readings in glowing green letters, changed. The monster shook him, and then shopped, shaking him gently again.

*Eph*, the words in the helmet said. *It's me.*
