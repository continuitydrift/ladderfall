# 8: The Tunnel

"Wait," Debria said, as Eph twisted his helmet back on and started to climb up into the hole the receding sands had left behind the door, more of it spilling down on to her side of the cabin.

"Why?" Eph asked. "It's obvious that the sand, or something out there, is trying to tell us this is what we should do. Maybe that's where our symbiotes went, to go get help. And it's here." The claustrophobia was back, stronger than right after the crash. For all the time he'd spent in this ship, months in complete solitude, spending even a minute more in the cramped cabin seemed intolerable.

"Don't forget that I've been on this planet before," Debria said, a surprising hardness in her voice. "With rich tourists. They always want to go out on the sands, to see them up close, and I always tell them the same thing: it isn't safe. The seas are unpredictable. As soon as you are sure what they are, what they will do, the sands will prove you wrong." She climbed up and stood on his arm-rest, looking over Eph's shoulder into the darkness. "Something doesn't feel right."

"What choice do we have?" Eph asked, his voice coming through the speakers on the chest-plate of his suit. "We can't stay here forever. It's almost night on the surface. We were going to dig ourselves out soon anyway. And now the door opens on its own, and this tunnel magically appars."

"It's not magic," Debria said. "You started to open up the hatch earlier, then the residual power was drained. It came back on, and the door finished opening." Some of the system had started to come back online. Eph could hear the familiar buzzes and ticks of the ship's basic functions, although the displays were still dark.

"Okay, but when it opened, the sand went *backward*, even uphill. You didn't see it, but it did. How do you explain that?"

Debria shrugged. "Do you at least have any weapons?" Eph found a small utility laser, the size of a small flashlight, and handed it to her. He grabbed the crowbar he'd used to try and pry open the hatch.

"I'll go first," he said. "If the tunnel starts sloping up, then we can wait until we're sure it's dark out there." 

The tunnel, though, didn't seem to get any closer to the surface. If anything, it sloped deeper into the planet, the wall rough and uneven, as if sculpted by some large, crude implement. The sand was compact but not solid, yielding to their steps, even rebounding with a sticky squelch. Debria could walk standing up, but Eph had to hunch over.

"We don't even know if we're headed in the right direction," Debria pointed out. Both of them had lights on the side of their helmet set to narrow beams, and when Eph looked back at her they both jerked their heads, temporarily blinding one another.

"Once we get to the surface, we should be able to get readings," he said. "But this is the right way. I'm sure of it." The tunnel snaked to the left and right, at times declining sharply enough that they sat and slid down on their butts, Eph using the crowbar to dig in and pull them up the corresponding rise. He thought he noticed something odd about the way the sand filled the divets left by the crowbar, the grains on the bottom edge rolling upward to fill the hole.

"So what now?" Debria asked when they came to an intersection, the tunnel meeting another of the same size running almost perpendicular, but with the passage on the left leading slightly upward.

"I don't know," Eph said, using the slightly higher ceiling to stretch his back. "You're the guide." Even through the helmet visor Eph could see the flash of her teeth as she grinned. She slapped him on the arm, nudging him aside as she took the lead, continuing in the same direction they'd been going. After a while, she stopped. "What is it?" Eph asked.

"I hear something." 

Listening, Eph could hear it too, a skittering, bubbling sound, coming from behind them. It got louder, enough to shake grains of sand down from the ceiling. About ten yards behind them, the tunnel wall started to tremble, then collapse inward. A creature tumbled into the tunnel, four claws held like scythes in front of a gibbering mouth, compound eyes glinting in the beams of light that caught steam rising from a long, segmented carapace. 

A jet of inky liquid squirted from its mouth and landed on the tunnel in front of it, and the sand where the excretion touched contracted, as if deflating. A declivity formed, pulling the monster forward, and beginning to draw them down into the pit it was creating.
