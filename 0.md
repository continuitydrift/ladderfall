# 0: Prologue

The ship crashed through the window.

Up until the moment the flying galleon broad-sided the second floor balcony of the Sun King's newly finished and exquisitely furnished summer palace, the window had been the most renowned in Europe. The gilt framing was carved into baroque panoramas, murmuring looped mythologies. The stained glass compressed thousands of hours of hot human labor, furnaces for boiling sand and air poisoned by lead.

In this world, and all those linked together by the phenomenon called Continuity Drift, there is a bacteria in the roots of certain trees, and the cells of certain animals, that rather than fixing nitrogen or some other chemical, fixes *gravity*, allowing those organisms to float. The more trees, drifted land, or biomass gathered together, the higher they could go.

For a short time, wood retains the antigravitational properties of the living symbiosis of bacteria and tree, the preserved cellulose an imperfect host for the micro-ecologies of gravity eaters. The carvings on the window were made out of imported gravgen wood, doubly wasteful in that their delicate effects of floating scenery and interlocking rings would only last a few months beyond its completion. Thus was the Sun King's vanity and madness.

The Comici Malfamati were stunned by the wealth and grotesque profligacy, after having spent the last few years struggling through wars, exile, poverty, and disease, only to find unexpected patrons among the Parisian elite, and be invited to perform for a royal dinner in their sky-rooted summer estate.

This isn't the story you are about to read. The scene of the upstart troupe of improvisational comedians, whose performance in the king's floating palace is interrupted by a dimensional storm, is from the second novel in the Continuity Drift series. Why bring all this up, when Ladderfall is in a different world entirely? I just wanted to give you, if you are jumping into this multiverse here, a proleptic glimpse, or foreshadowing of where the novel I might work on in November would be headed.

The symbiotic fungus or bacteria that reverses gravity is highly prized, and the wood that hosts it has been, in the dimension of the *commedia* actors, the cause of many brutal wars as tyrants fight for control over floating arboreal islands, to lift themselves higher while forcing others down. It also explains why there is a flying ship, which crashed through the window behind the stage, and why that stage, also, was floating, before it smashed through the window and the stage, and the actors start to fall sideways toward the perfumed crowd of courtesan Parisians.

The troupe of comedians, especially the Harlequina, expected the night to be of monumental importance in their lives, but along more established lines, resolving romantic, political, and class tensions that had been present since their arrival in the country. She hated having the significance of the even dictated on the terms of the nobility, but had thrilled at the thought of going down in eloquent rebellion. Even if it meant condemning the Captain, the Doctor, the lovers, and the other *zanni* to future bureaucratic embarrassments or physical deprivations on their way back across a hostile Europe.

After the ship careened through the most expensive window in the empire, the changes wreaked by that one summer night in 1688
