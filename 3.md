# Ladderfall

As soon as Debria's lips touched his, Eph felt his thought begin to shift, down far below his conscious mind, like tectonic plates sliding far beneath a planet's mantle.

She, also, was a Vestige. There was a symbiote in her, too. He had his hand on the back of her head, underneath the flap of curls where he'd had a strange compulsion to run his fingers, ever since he had met her. Among the stubble of the undercut he felt something else, hidden by the hair. Crystals. 

"You're one of the pirates," he said. Debria nodded, biting her lower lip. They'd taken the helmets off their EV suits once they'd come aboard Ladderfall, the air stale but breathable, and now the neck rings bumped against each other awkwardly.

"What I told you is true, though. I am a Guide. I've been to the surface, many times. I know Dr. Shin, and can take you to her. I just need..."

"A ship," Eph finished. 

After they had finished their drinks, Eph and Debria had made their way through the low-grav walking strips to the loading bay, where Ladderfall was docked. In the airlock, where they had changed into their suits, Eph had noticed her staring at his body. Probably looking for scars.

They had hooked onto the guide wires, and in the long drop to the flower-like spokes of ships, there had been time to talk. Eph found himself liking Debria's voice, with its strange accent and choice of words, perhaps a little slurred, as was his, from the drinks they had shared. The thousands of parked ships, each the key to a point of view, a life, as immanent and significant as his own. Terminus, with its compact matrix of human existence, humbled him, reminded him of the non-uniqueness of his being, which his long Eidolon slips sometimes allowed him to forget.

He felt his self-concept oscillate between two extremes, like light stretched between a black hole and a sun: there is no one to understand me, since I am unique, and I no one cares about me, since I am just like everyone else.

She had told him about herself, her work as a Guide, someone who pitched and packaged the beauty of Zoax and its evocative mysteries, poised as it was between the generative sun and consuming dark. How despite the real and indisputable sublimity of the place, she became mired in petty squabbles and power plays, a pawn amongst the egoistic battles of scholars and politicians, when all she wanted to do was to help people stick their toes right up against the edge of the unknowable, to give them a memory they could carry with them, burning, back into their mundane lives.

The control deck of Ladderfall was more spacious than his roon in the orbital station (Eph had made adjustments to accomodate his size), but it enfolded him with an atmosphere both comfortable and familiar. The chimes he'd hung in front of the vents tinkled as the ship made the air breathable again. The succulents and climing vines had been tended to by the hydroponic systems, and despite a few dead leaves still greeted him with their usual persistent, dogged determination to grow towards light and life.

When they took off their helmets, Eph missed the sound of Debria's voice next to his ear. Although she was physically closer, now she sounded farther away. The ships logs were up on the main display.

"I've never heard of those planets," she had said. He laughed. "No one has. There's something wrong with the nav system. It's been doing that since I traded for the ship, showing records of sectors that don't exist. I don't know why."

She'd turned from the screen to face him, smiling again, this time her teeth seeming to glow velvet red.

"Can I kiss you?" she had asked.
