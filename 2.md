# Debria

<!--I rolled the "Forge a Bond" move, and got a weak hit. The action die rolled a 6, +2 for Heart, and the challenge dice were 4 and 8.-->

"Most people out in the Void are gene-modded to be small, for practical reasons. They take up less space, need fewer calories." Eph was watching Debria's sharp, expressive features, wanting her to like him. This was the longest conversation he'd had with anyone since arriving on Aegis, probably since he left his family and tribe back in the Void.

Out on his long solo runs in Ladderfall, his solitude had seemed natural. In Terminus, though, being surrounded by people, without relating to any of them, made him lonely. "I always thought smaller body types were...selected for, when our ancestors fled the Cataclysm."

Eph didn't want to disgust her by explaining about his size. She had asked, though, and he wanted to be honest. He sighed. "They were, for the most part. It turns out, though that there are certain things humans need to survive. Rare minerals, complex proteins, bacteria or enzymes. The most efficient way to synthesize them, my people learned, was within a biological organism. Chemical or technological processes just can't beat evolution in terms of efficiency."

"Like...the Whale. Isn't that your call sign?"

The Whale was a legend from the migration, probably apocryphal. One of the giant colony ships had been built around an interior sea, with an up-lifted whale that served as a pharmacopia, as well as a source of ferltilizer and medicine. "Exactly. Except the easiest way to synthesize the kind of things humans need to survive is...inside a human."  Eph took another sip of meteor milk, some kind of double-distilled fig brandy mixed with stimulants that Debria had recommended, trying to collect his thoughts.

The observation window blistered out around the surprisingly unconfortable tables, showing a much clearer picture of the planet-hidden sun and anti-sun, the colorful interplay of heat and cold, ribbon bridges of incandescent light and gas. Scientists used the observation deck as an overflow lounge for their adjacent laboratories, cracked interface screens either lying flat on tables or fixed vertically, transparent surfaces filled with dancing notes and equations, ill-washed intellectuals tapping on them with light-pens, gesturing at the celestial panorama, talking in muted tones.

Others, who must be the pirates, stumbled through the walkways, incapacitated either by drink or unfamiliar gravity settings, but with irrepressible swagger, tattoos, and tell-tale mutations or bio-mods, with swords or external lungs strapped across their hips or shoulders.

"So, wait, your crew mates took your blood in transfusions, like vampires, for antibodies and trace minerals?" 

Eph looked at her and then away again, afraid to go on. If she was going to be disgusted, to change her mind about whatever offer she was prepared to make, this would be the time.

"No, just getting my blood wouldn't be enough. There was good surgical equipment on board, and regen kits, so they would cut out strips of subcutaneous fat and, well, eat them."

Debria lowered her drink to the table, looking up into his eyes. Then she smiled again, flashing her teeth, which seemed green under this lighting. She pushed a button, and refilled the glass from a tube under the table. She took what was left of his, swallowed it, and then filled his as well with the milky liquid.

"So you weren't just their pharmacy, you were their *farm*. A loophole in the vegetarian laws."

"Yeah, I guess. My system is designed to process unusual toxins, to fix nutrients and antibodies in my flesh. I'm also...delicious. So I was told." Eph liked Debria's laugh. "The life expectancy for people like me isn't very high. M engineered metabolism, designed to handle weird contaminants, was probably what allowed my symbiote to make me its host."

"I want to hear this whole story sometime. I only know what was in your file. You were afraid your tribe would get infected, too, the next time you were...harvested?"

Eph looked down at some text scrolling across the edge of the table. *Don't tell her about me. I don't trust her* he read, knowing the words would only be visible to him, that if Debria looked at them she would only see some menu items, or a scrolling ticker of orbital news.

"No, it wasn't that. The symbiot just wanted...we wanted...to leave."

"And you were afraid they would come after you? Because you were taking their food source, their medicine?"

"Yeah. I also stole something. An heirloom, from the homeworlds. A sword. It's what I traded for my ship."
