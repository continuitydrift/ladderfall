# 5: Descent

A jolt told them they had hooked onto the elevator, the seats swinging on two axes as they adjusted to the new gravitational pressures pulling them against the resistance of the cable, and then down towards Zoax. They had met the hook with the planet in the shield display above them, the orbital below, and as Eph felt his internal organs rearrange themselves, he could see the bright miniscus of the sunward side of the planet, along with the skeins of radiation clawing around it from the black hole, light years away, but equally deadly. There was an eerienear-silence as the engines shut down, Ladderfall switching solely to the power provided by the cable, both the momentum generated by the planet's spin, and the energy harvested from the coupling with the wire.

Debria let out a breath she'd been holding, ending in nervous, almost hysterical laughter.

"I thought you said that was safe," Eph said, turning his head to face her once the gravitational forces allowed him to easily do so.

"It was," she answered. "Mostly. The software I used was a little...unorthodox. Your ship wasn't really designed for this." Elevator accidents were not an uncommon occurence on Aegis, and a morbid legend held that at the altitude of the space hook there was a ring around Zoax of wrecked ships and corpses. In order to reduce chances of collision, in the event of their descruction both vehicles and suits were programmed to use any residual energy to clump themselves together, so the results of these accidents were distributed as little asteroids of mangled hulls and limbs, to haunt the nightmares of any pilots unfortunate enough to encounter them.

Just one more item on the long list of ways that this world was trying to kill them.

Eph noticed the crystals under Debria's hair glowing, an algal blue that matched the current tint of her teeth.

"Can I ask you something? About your symbiote?"

Debria nodded, not registering any surprise or embarassment that he knew she was carrying a rider, like his own. She loosened the seat restraints, leaning over to the control panel to make small adjustments to the controls. "Did it make me kiss you? Is that what you want to ask?"

"No!" Eph paused. "I mean...I didn't before, but now that you brought it up..."

"We both wanted to kiss you, for different reasons. Curiosity, I guess. We like you, and honestly, we need your help. It seemed like a way to save some time. You?"

"It's hard for me to tell what it wants. It did say it didn't trust you, back on the orbital. I think it changed its mind. Changed my mind, maybe. Sometimes I wonder if it's really me making decisions, you know? Like agreeing to this, going with you to the surface, right before the radiation bursts are supposed to hit..."

*This is what you wanted* appeared on the display, nested among the scrolling telemetry data. *I don't make decisions for you*.

"Does yours communicate through textual hallucinations, replacing what you see when you look at written words?"

Debria looked at him, thoughtfully, running her fingers on the glowing part of her scalp. "No. For me, it's auditory. I hear their voice, instead of the sound of other words."

Eph was alarmed. "So when I'm talking to you, are you really hearing them?"

She smiled, reaching over to squeeze his hand. "No, it doesn't work like that. Thankfully, it only replaces recorded speech, or AI voices. It's useful, actually, to know when I'm talking to a program."

"Yeah, for me, it doesn't happen with handwriting. That's why I still use actual paper, when I want to be alone."

As the planet got closer, the surface grew brighter, the lumanescent tentacles of the black hole filtered by the still-hidden sun threatening the horizon. They'd passed the half-way point, the angle of their seats shifting again, their speed starting to perceptibly decrease. They both sucked water from the tubes fixed to the head rests, the chimes by the vents signaling that the climate control had stepped up its efforts to keep them alive.

On the surface, which was now more below than above them, the obelisk was clearly visible, illuminated by the landing lights. The drift seas undulated in uneven blues and greys, the same color, Eph realized, as the crystals growing from Debria's skull.

"Did your symbiote bring you here? Sometimes I feel like I don't even have a choice, that they are making decisions for me. They deny it, but sometimes I think *I'm* the rider, and its the one in control."

Debria shrugged. "It's a philosophical question. Does free will really exist for anyone? The conscious part of our brain is, ultimately, a relatively insignificant parasite on the deeper processes beneath the surface of awareness. What does it matter if, for us, one of those processes can communicate?" As they got closer, they could see the network of fine, shifting lines that webbed across the seas of memetic sands, muted violet against the metallic blue. "I was bonded to the grub pirates for five years after they captured my family's agricultural barge, and took on the debt we owed to the colony. Personally, I'd rather be a slave to some weird precursor virus than to a conglomerate."

Eph thought of his own family, all the flesh grown and harvested from his bones, the gene mods that turned him into a biological factory, condemning him to a short, monstrous life. He thought about what Debria had said about the pirates, how they hadn't come to the orbital to take control or scavenge, but to save it. Maybe the same was true of their symbiotes.

"Okay, now's the tricky part," Debria said, tightening the straps of her seat again and pinching apart her half of the display to magnify the bulls-eye ridges of the research site, where the sands had been cleared away to reveal pinkish bedrock. "Prepare for landing."
