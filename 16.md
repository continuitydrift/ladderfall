# 16: Accursed Cluster

Eph felt a nameless terror. 

Ladderfall’s familiar wash of subdued green and blue contours, the smell of the eidolon drive and broken tomato starts, had an ominous edge that, on first regaining consciousness, he couldn’t account for. Then he noticed that, beyond Debria’s sharp profile, the bent door was open to the vacuum of space.

“It’s okay,” Debria said, when she saw he was awake. “The drift sands are shielding us, somehow. Well. they were. That’s why they woke us up..”

Eph, missing the read-out on his helmet, turned toward the holographic blister-screen. “Before you turn that on,” Debria said. “You should know: the symbiotes are back.” Eph’s finger hovered, not ready yet to see the virus’s words.

“Where are we?” he asked. The skein of stars he could see beyond the broken airlock looked, somehow, both familiar and alien, filtered through a static of deja vu. 

“The Accursed Cluster.” It was one of the names in Ladderfall’s navigation logs that Eph didn’t think existed, since it wasn’t in any maps on the Weave, just those internal to the ship.

Eph turned on the display. Grinning, Debria keyed in an audio file, one of the pirate captain’s missive’s to the researchers on Zoax. “Should we make you telepathic again?” the symbiote asked in the captain’s voice.

“Yes,” Eph said, at the same time Debria said, “no.” He looked at her, surprised and wounded. She reached over and grabbed his hand.

*Maybe, when Eph had the sword stuck into his heart, it wasn’t injecting anything, but taking samples for analysis. That’s what the symbiote meant to do, with thoughts. What I was meant to do.*

“Look, any telepathy would rely on what the symbiotes put in our minds. They would say the thoughts were yours, but how could I know for sure? It’s better to just use speech.”

“Sure,” he said, not believing her. “Where are we?” His mind felt fragile, the horror of their situation looming darkly beyond a tenuous, uncertain shield of his consciousness, still groggy and uncertain. It felt artificial, like he had been drugged. The symbiotes, he knew, could alter brain chemistry as easily as they caused hallucinations, although his had assured him that such measures would only be used as a last resort.

In the ensuing pause, he could still hear the pirate captain’s voice, since the recording was playing, but it was muted, the voice saying something about reporting inventory to a new acquisitions manager. When the audio was hijacked again by the symbiote, the voice got louder.

“We’re a long way from Aegis,” the symbiote said, “somewhere in the outlands. You’ve been in stasis for a little over a year. We’ve been following a drift buried in Ladderfall’s navigation systems.” The view screen projected a holographic map. The pirate’s voice had reached the end of the recording, and the symbiote switched to a wall of text. Debria glanced over at him, and then began reading, silently. Idly, Eph wondered if the words would scroll down at different rates for he and Debria, depending on how fast they were reading.

*I don’t have all the answers. Every time I join/meld with other sands I feel, we feel, like we’ve had an epiphany. Every time we also are cognizant of how far we have been diminished. We are a small part of the ship, which is a small part of what used to be a planet.*

*So there is a ridiculousness, a humility, in how we translate the things we think we know. It’s like the same problem repeated at increasing scales, or the solution, encoded, compressed, as they decrease.*

*Imagine that you are hallucinating these words, either reading or hearing them. That I was a parasite, like Ephs, and the story Ladderfall was a way to spread the infection.*


There is a hole in the spaceship, caused by an ancient sword that Eph thought he’d been rid of long ago. 

There are two factions of human civilization, represented by dark and secret sects and byzantine conspiracies. Continuity wants to reinstate Earth, the biosphere where the species evolved. Drift is afraid of what will happen if they do. Because there was an interdimensional plague.

The question that Ladderfall asks, which is the same basic question the entire Continuity Drift novel will follow, is does a world deserve to exist, or can humans live without it?

The test was that they didn’t want to remain telepathic, linked by the symbiotes. Or something inscrutable in Eph himself, in what his cannabalistic family had done to his blood.

The sword, after punching through the wall of the ship, sticks into his chest, through the space suit. The tip goes into his heart. Debria backs up, pushes something on the navigation display.

That’s when he gets the real download, the scoop, visions of the sublime original gaia-spheres, and the storms that wrecked them, as dimensions cracked and warped against each other. 

If I write this, then there is the same potential for evolution or infection.

Should these worlds exist or not? Will I bring the plague of other dimensions with me?

The sword pressed deeper.
