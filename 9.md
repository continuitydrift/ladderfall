# 9: Rock Sledding

When he was fourteen, just after his birthday, a group of older teenagers had invited him to go rock sledding, in an abandoned course near a re-feul station in Sigil, on the edge of an asteroid belt. Despite the site's reputation, his parents had agreed to let him go, possibly out of guilt, or because his older sister was dating one of the boys, and promised to keep him safe.

Eph had been in awe of his sisters' friends, some of whom were the rough-handed, tattooed offspring of miners or mechanics, while others, like her boyfriend, were from the wealthier sections of the colony ship, with atriums and private theaters. These had styled hair, clean clothes, and strange, expensive smells. They used expressions that he did his best to imitate, and in-jokes that he laughed at despite not understanding.

They teased him for his size, and for not knowing things they had learned at school, information not included in the recorded lessons he watched while his parents were at work. 

"What's the point?" he had once overheard his father say, when his mother had wanted to pay to send him to classes in the upper decks. "No one will train or hire him when he won't live past his thirties."

Eph had started giving his flesh the year before, and the regen drugs and heavy meals had made him lethargic. Rock sledding races were one of the few things that could hold his attention, and he would spend hours watching clips of famous racers, and playing with toy sleds he made out of scrap, sliding them along wires in his room, pretending they were gravity beams.

Rock sledding tracks were usually set up in remote asteroid fields, where gravity condensers were drilled into the rocks, which collected and focused the gravitational pull into narrow beams, capable of drawing small sleds, little more than cargo palates with minimal steering and life support, at alarming speeds. 

The technology, once heralded as revolutionary, had largely been abandoned when it was found, if used at scale, to result in the instability of planetary cores, resulting in quakes and, in the case of a few spectacular catastrophes, planets exploding.

The only application for the technology that survived were rock sledding courses, where the size of the gravity sources, and the objects being propelled (often re-purposed sleds from mining sites) meant that the objects and people involved were expendable, if not exactly safe.

Lasers keyed to the sled's navigation kept them locked onto the beams, although there was still a fair amount of skilled piloting necessary, in turning off the tractor hooks and intersecting the countervailing vertices in time to avoid collision with the attracting meteors.

The sleds were meant to hold two people but Eph was large enough that he needed one to himself. There were also safety protocols built in, to cap the gravitational strengths the sleds could absorb, and therefore speeds they could achieve. The older kids, however, changed the safety settings on Eph's sled as a joke. Eph's sister, afterwards, had denied knowing about the sabotage.

Eph had been exhilarated, after the first few legs of the track through the scattered meteors, to be able to pull ahead of the others, until egged on by their cheers, had over-shot one of the tethers, flying out into empty space, unable to intersect any of the gravitational beams that could have brought him back.

This was a not uncommon event, and would have ended with his friends following his signal and picking him up once they were done racing, if he hadn't, after twenty minutes of floating helplessly, entered into a micro-meteor swarm, probably pulled towards the course by a stray beam. As he watched through the shield of his immobilized sled, several of the larger rocks collided, bursting apart in a luminescent spray, which was the last thing he remembered seeing.

Eph had woken up in the medical bay of the colony ship, tubes running into his chest and arms, machines beating his heart and expanding his lungs, regen patches covering points on his skin of acute pain, and a soreness in his skull that was also, somehow, a source of light. At first he thought he had been harvested again, that they had taken more of his blood and flesh for the nutrients he had been bred to synthesize, but then he felt that the opposite had occurred: something had been put *into* him instead.

On the transparent screen of the medical bed in front of his face were read-outs of his vital signs, reversed, meant for the doctors. Beyond that was a poster, with a picture of hands being washed, and red lettering. In place of the simple admonition and instructions Eph knew should be there were the words: *don't be afraid. I'm in your mind, and can hear your thoughts. I'm not human. I was traveling in the asteroid, from far away. I saved you. From now on, you won't be alone.
