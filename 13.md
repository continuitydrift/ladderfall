# 13: Escape Velocity

“We’re about to launch. We were waiting for you. We need to hurry.”

Eph and Debria looked at each other, the ran after the alien worm with a human head, down into the tunnel. They were quickly out of breath. “Sit down,” the head of Magnus Shin said, from between the four segmented claws. When they had, the drift sand started to fall away beneath them, while the roc worm disappeared, spinning like a drill bit. They slid, quickly and painlessly, down into the darkness.

There was a moment when all of them were linked, through the symbiotes. Adrenaline had heightened their senses, preparing them for death. They were a ship, tearing free from the vast gravity of the planet, the nose of the obelisk straining upward, towards a distant, unknown thing, the profound pull of which was enough, barely, to balance out the weight of Aegis, out of which this new, space-born body had been carved, pulled free like an uprooted plant.

Debria felt the contents of her soul opened, integrated, made use of like her mind was a box of tools, or circuits, and there was a many-fingered ghost selecting what it needed, plugging her into a god-like machine. She saw herself from far away. She would never be the same.
 
The ship, which had been a planet, was directing all of their mental energy, coordinating their primate cortical power, towards steering the precursor ship through meteor clouds and solar winds. It was a matter of trajectories, like casting a rock from a sling at a flying bird. It had been a long time since this dimension, with its physical laws, had been anything for the drift-sands but a computational medium, like a pot that its reality had outgrown, but in which it remained rooted. Now that its world was ending, and it had to return to its birth-plane of existence, but needed human psyches to remember how it worked.

The telepathy extended, in those seconds when their survival depended on it, to the bones and membranes of the ship itself, risen out of and consisting of the drift sands. Six sparking, glitch-radiant tentacles, ending in different ships that had been strategically placed along the planetary ley lines, which were now the veins and ligaments of this flying thing. One of them was Ladderfall, changed into a flaming, winged foot of this apocalypse-escaping monster. She could feel the precursor intelligence using Eph to pilot it.

One of the obstacles they had to avoid was the wreckage of the recently destroyed *Vera*, as it spiraled in uncertain arcs to the surface of Aegis, the massive black hole, or the sun. Their shared, slowed down hyper-focus fixated, horrifically, on the carnage. Most, but not all, had been evacuated. One dead rescue ship with a missing nose and wing struck, unavoidably, the skein of the ascending Precursor arc, with a sickening absorption.

The grief and terror at Vera’s destruction, Debria realized, was deepened by its resonance with the inconceivably greater loss sustained by the sentient planet itself, having wrenched itself away as a mere fragment of its gaia-mind, which had been, not just a memorial to a bygone civilization, but *the civilization itself*, albeit transformed into a crystalline matrix capable of projecting its true complexity into hidden, orthogonal dimensions.

The ship used the psychic linkage to let its vast, sleeping systems tap into their knowledge, memories, and instincts of spaceflight, reshaping its form to the specifications their subconscious super-minds suggested. 

There had been these mechanical humming-bird type drones, or constructs, with shimmering scales. When they flew up to Debria, time had dilated. Each wing-beat lasted as long as it would have to draw a breath, if her breathing also hadn’t slowed. Subjective minutes passed between beats of her heart.

An exquisite yet inconceivably terrifying moment of compression, of focus, every pathway in her brain tugged out at once, like unwinding thread, spooled into the alien cognition of the ship.

At the moment they realized they would survive, when the pendulum swung from gut-sick terror to unrestrained elation, the telepathy disappeared. Debria staggered, instantly pounded with an existential loneliness. Her symbiote had disappeared. Within a moment, she had gone from sharing her mind, and the intense emotions of their harrowing escape, with human and non-human souls, to being completely alone. It had been decades since her symbiote had infected her, its presence always felt even when it wasn’t speaking. She had thought she would die, but linked with others. Now, she realized, she would have to live, like this, from now on, with no thoughts other than her own.

“Do you think we still have free will?” Debria asked, laying next to Eph in the dark, in one of the empty cabins. The body of the ship was the research station, the obelisk the nose-cone, with the tendrils of drift-sands and ship engines like the tentacles of a jellyfish.

“What do you mean?” Eph rolled his considerable bulk onto his side, almost forcing her off the edge of the bed before he moved closer to the wall.

They hadn’t had sex–after being linked, mentally, it had seemed almost superfluous, but both of them had, wordlessly,  sought out and offered physical comfort in the face of the crushing sense of isolation that had come with being trapped, again, alone in their skulls.

“Do we have any choice, at this point, where we go, what happens to us? You saw into that thing as well as me, the amount of control it could exercise, so far into the future, with so many variables…it's beyond human.”

Both Eph and Debria had been manipulated, or guided, to bring their symbiotes to Aegis, both of them also unwittingly carrying the rare elements the planet-mind had needed to catalyze its escape, before the solar flare cooked it into ash and junk.

The wall beeped, and Debria blinked, to take the call. The head of Magnus Shin appeared, still held in the mandibles of the rock worm.

“Come to the bridge,” the scientist said. “We need to talk about where we’re going.”
