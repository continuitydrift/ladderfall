# 11: The Surface

The sands under their boots had the consistency of peat, every step sending up vaporous spores caught in the cones of light sent from the wrists and necks of their suits. Even though there was no atmosphere, whatever bizarre physics was at play in the memetic substrate caused the grains to swirl and shift, refracting light. Walking, he and Debria left three-dimensional cut outs of the waist-high space through which they had traveled, slowly deforming and closing after they had passed.

Gravity on Zoax was less than standard, with far weaker pull than the planet should have had according to its size and inferred mass. There were two popular explanations for the discrepancy: either the planet was hollow, or it was somehow generating anti-gravity. Neither of these explanations were allowed for in traditional physics. A third explanation, less favored by researchers because it wasn't generally splashy or attention-grabbing enough to win grant money, held that the lower-than-expected gravity was related to the unexplained forces at play between the sun and black hole, in closer proximity relative to their size than anywhere else in the recorded galaxy.  

The slew of stars above them seemed brighter than it had on Aegis, the colors draining blue into the hole poked in the sky. They had followed one of the cross-tunnels out to the surface, the maps in their suits coming back online. They had a good distance yet to travel to get to the obelisk, barely visible on the horizon. When they had encountered one of the ley-lines, the sand got less spongy, and the path to the vault more clear. The glowing, web-like threads that had been visible from space weren't on the surface, but a good distance underneath. The planet, far below, luminesced with aquatic colors, striated by the shifting depths. Eph turned his helmet display off, and tried to think about what had happened.

The symbiote was talking to it in her helmet. He didn't want to listen. Eph wanted to be alone.

The feeling of revulsion he had felt when the rock worm was on top of him, the probisci inserting themselves into the ports of the suit, hadn't gone away. For all the vestige's reassurances that the creature had just been a *construct* and wouldn't have actually hurt them, Eph knew that he had seem something monstrous in the memetic virus, a terror that was real.

As soon as the word's *It's me* had blinked into his vision in the corner of the helmet display, the rock worm had turned grey and blue above him, partly transparent, as if crystalline, the same color as the tunnel walls. The creature decohered, pinning Eph with falling gears and bones, revealing itself to be a cybernetic or somatic illusion, something dreamed of by the planet.

There had been visions, in the weeks after the rock-sledding accident, of sheer, nine-eyed terror, that Eph had forgotten surprisingly well and quickly. The symbiote had done a good job of keeping those memories out of reach, but seeing the alien creature had brought them back. The grief for a galaxy, compressed.

 The obelisk came in and out of view, more and more visible as they approached, details appearing in the strange runic bands that ran along its vertices. Its scale was both sinister and beautiful, the only feature in a blurred, desaturated horizon.

 "You pinned me down," Eph had said to the symbiote, after they had started walking to the surface. "I couldn't move."

 *If I hadn't, the transfer might have been corrupted. I was protecting you.*

 "No," Eph had said. It was too much like the other thing, the straps on operating tables. He remembered the pictures the med-techs had shown him, the thing growing in his brain, too closely twined into the tissues to be cut out. An alien parasite from a doomed dimension, sent into the void like a last fungal spore blooming on a corpse.

 There had been something else. His disgust towards the rock worm was partly directed inwards. The symbiote had been with him for so long, he'd started to think of it as himself. When it had been outside the ship, in the planet, it had joined with the version or portion of itself that had been in Debria. For a moment, when the creature was disintegrating and the pseudoghost was flooding back into his mind, he had seen himself as Debria had seen him, had known her thoughts. It had been like looking into the recursive corridor of two mirrors facing each other, a vertigo of folded points of view, more intimate and terrifying than when she had kissed him. This time, there was no question that their closeness, the telepathic overlap, was mediated by their symbiotes, which now were the same.

 Eph looked over at Debria through the wisps of floating sand, still talking to the ghost inside her helmet.

 *Project this on the tunnel wall*, the symbiote had told Eph, and when he did, he saw: *You need to get to the surface. If you start moving now you can get there before morning.*

 "I can read it," Debria had said, staring in fascination at the letters. "Let me try something." She had said something in the helmet, he mouth moving without sound. Then she played her recorded voice, and for the first time, Eph had heard the symbiote's voice, superimposed, or constructed from, the sounds of Debria's.

 "It's good to be with both of you again."

 "No," Eph had said, turning off his display and the sound in his helmet. Debria's face had been hurt and confused, but after a few moments she had turned and started walking down the tunnel, and he had followed her.

 They'd walked in silence for hours, both Debria and the symbiote giving him time to think, only checking if he was okay when they finally made it to the surface, digging through the last of the sticky sand where the symbiote, in its monstrous form, had filled the hole to keep out the heat. Then more hours of walking, through the strange mist that left the trace of their passage, the obelisk growing larger and brighter until they had to look up to see the top.

 "Eph," Debria finally said. "The symbiote wants to talk to you. They're sorry. They saw how scared you were. I did, too. They want to talk to you before we get to the site."

 "Why?" Eph asked. "Why does it matter what I think or want? They brought us here. For whatever reason, it's going to happen. They're going to use us, to take us over, whether we want them to or not."

 "It's not like that," Debria said. "The symbiote has a better idea what it used to be, what the purpose of this Vault, this whole planet is, but it doesn't know everything. They're as confused as we are."

 Eph stopped walking, sucking down a sludge of tasteless proteins from the feeding tube sticking out of the neck of the suit. He turned the projector on his chest plate on, sending the display from his helmet, a page of poetry from the ancient homeworld, out into the curling wall of dust. "Go ahead," Eph said, talking to the thing in his mind. "What is this place, really? Why did you bring us here."

 *It wasn't you this planet needed,* the words became when the poem scrolled to a new stanza. *It was your ship. It was Ladderfall.*
