# 17: Earth

The sword slid slowly out of Eph’s chest. Searing pain was followed by a groggy warmth, then a hyper-alertness, as if dust had been blown off his mental circuits. He heard his heartbeat, distinctly, four times, and could feel changes branching through his veins, bringing him back to himself, or the kind of person he would have been had his life not been steeped in terror and resentment.

 He thought he was falling, but realized he was being pulled towards the broken hatch, venting the ship’s oxygen into space. 

“Eph!” Debria shouted. The crystals on her head were pulsing aqueous colors, matching the lights from Ladderfall’s screens, where they weren’t blood red with warnings. Words appeared, glitching into the air, lines from the epic poem, almost completed, morphing into a message.

*Eph. We can’t control the sands much longer. I wish I could say this is a decision, that there is a choice. It’s beyond that, now. You need to leave the ship.*

As he read the words Eph could also hear a voice, or the thought of a voice, assembled somehow from the noise of venting air and untuned motors. The word “ship” had coincided with a shriek of stressed metal.

They lurched, and Debria grabbed his waist. Several of the crystals had fallen off her scalp, no longer glowing, breaking into dust on the grates. 

“What?!” Debria shouted, having apparently heard the symbiote as well. “Eph’s suit has a hole in the chest! We’re in the middle of space!”

“I’ve hyper-oxygenated your blood. That should last long enough. Both of you, take off your suits.”

Eph looked down at the red flower blooming on the gray material, then up at the sword, still hovering in the air, but pointed away instead of at him. He started unfastening straps and buckles.

Debria rubbed her head, and more crystals fell to the floor, luminescing green when they broke, glowing lines branching out to the seams of the ship.

Everything got quieter as the gravity and engines failed. It was easier to get the suits off when they were floating, drifting behind them like the discarded shells of insects.

“Grab the sword,” the symbiote said when they were in their underwear. The entire left wall of the ship groaningly detached from the rest of Ladderfall. Blood started floating out from Eph’s chest in scarlet globules. The holographic screens were blank.

Eph felt a flash of anger: all he had done, everything he had risked, and he was still just *material* being moved from one place to another, with no power to decide anything, or even know what the results of his actions would be. 

He grabbed the sword. Debria reached out as well, her fingers wrapping around the hilt, her other arm holding tightly to his bulk. The sword, with a shoulder-wrenching jolt, flew out of the missing wall, towing them with it, just before the ship dissolved into radiant dust. It got very cold, especially around Eph’s nose and mouth. His vision blurred. Debria hugged him closer, her face next to his. Neither of them took a breath. The rest of their clothes had disappeared, the two of them floating naked, squeezing each other tight in terror and awe, alone in a sea of starry darkness. They looked into each other’s eyes, and Eph felt the universe shift inside of him.

Behind them, the glowing dust of what had been Ladderfall attenuated into laser-straight lines, threads of light spreading out into a hexagonal grid, curving into a giant sphere. His eyes, searching for patterns even at the edge of death, picked out a pentagon among the hexes.

Once the geodesic bubble was complete, a roc worm materialized in front of them. “You can breathe,” it said.

They could. It was difficult at first, overcoming the expectation of a suffocating evacuation of their lungs. They gasped at first, then laughed. The air was odorless and tasteless, except for a vague hint of spice. 

“Are you my symbiote,” Debria asked, “or Eph’s?” 

*That distinction is no longer useful*, the precursor worm answered. Its voice was like the chirping of insects made of glass. 

“You have a choice,” the voice said, seeming to come from all directions at once. The hexagonal grid sent points of light traveling along its vertices, the planes shimmering like oil in water, distorting the stars behind them, each like a window into a different sky. “We can maintain this sphere, put you in suspension. There’s a derelict Outbounder in the next sector. We can repair its eidolon drive, and you can go to Anubis, or some other planet. You can work with us, bringing others here.”

“Or?” Debria asked. She’d let go of the sword, but was still holding onto Eph.

“We leave you. You can never be telepathic again. If we take you to the surface, you will never leave.” The mandibles around the worms quadrilateral eyes spun in expressive circles, the teeth rotating the opposite direction. 

“The surface?” Debria asked, but there was no answer. “Eph,” she said, “If this is what I think it is…”

“I don’t need the Earth,” Eph said, choking. “All I want is you. To feel your mind again.”

“That’s not true,” Debria said, softly. “All the humans I’ve known, they spend their lives chasing things they think will make them happy. A ship, a lover, power, wealth. I’ve never seen it work. There’s always something missing, some need perpetually unfulfilled. What if it’s Earth? What if what we’ve always needed was a home?”

The two humans and a worm floated in space, surrounded by star-filled hexagons. Eph thought for a moment they were telepathic again. Then he realized he just trusted her. And she was right.

“Okay,” Eph said. “What do we do?”

They weren’t moving through the air, but Eph knew somehow, perhaps by a slight parallax of stars, that they and the air were both descending. Below them, a dark blue dot was slowly growing bigger. The wall of hexagons was also rising to meet them, until one loomed below their feet, the size of a starship. Gravity was pulling them towards the planet faster than the hex-sphere was descending. They could see a halo of atmosphere, a corrugated dusting of clouds. The sun, Eph realized, had been hidden by the planet, the sphere descending along what would have been a line passing through them. That, or the precursors had simply been filtering out the light, making it seem they had been in empty space.

Something was strange about the sun, as it slid out from behind the planet. Its color and size seemed to pulse and breathe, morphing through different hues. The crescent of light showed opalescent seas, crusts of mountains and shaded forest valleys.

“That’s too small to be the Earth,” Debria said. The worm, as the space grew brighter, started to flicker and fade. The voice, when it came, sounded brittle and distant. “If this planet were the size of Earth, or the sun resembled Sol, then the Drift would find us here and destroy us. This world wouldn’t be large enough to support an Earth-like ecosystem, or have Earth-like gravity, but it is dimensionally entangled with a dozen other pseudo-Earths in other universes. 

“Oh God,” Debria said, staring at the precursor worm with its unsettling symmetry. “That’s what caused the Catastrophe. No wonder the Drift is trying to stop you.”

“A dimension’s first contact with the meta-lattice is almost always catastrophic. Predators and parasites are the first to come through the storms. For most worlds, though, interdimensionality ends up benefiting them, once they learn to work together, to join the metaversal collective, the Continuity. Over the millennia-long exodus to the Forge, we were working in secret, hiding as mind-viruses, collecting the sands and ships we needed to bind this dimension to others friendly to the cause. We’ve created this patchwork homeworld, assembled from the longing and memories of a dozen humanoid species, from a dozen destroyed Earths,  all equally broken and displaced.”

The voice stopped for Eph, but when he looked at Debria, her eyes were wide, as if she was listening, her forehead creased in thought. Her hand slid up and touched his, still gripping the sword. Her face held a question. She started to pull it from his fingers. There were bald spots on her head where the crystals had been, the skin raw and new.

She drew back the sword, huge and cold, above her shoulders. She threw it.

The sword struck one of the hexagons, the plane churning into nebulous swirls and coruscating lights. The sword was gone. A resonant, impossibly pure tone rang out, dripping with harmonics, followed by a silence more absolute than Any Eph had ever known. It got hard to breathe again, and cold. 

The land below them was growing rich with details. They were falling into a valley between mountains, the world darkening again as they were hidden from the weird sun. Goats were grazing in the cliffs, and flocks of birds tumbled in the thermals, their synchronicity reminding Eph of the drift sands blowing over Aegis.

The sphere around them grew smaller, and their descent slowed. The hexagons vanished except for the one they were standing on, Eph feeling a slight electrical charge on his bare feet. The oddly spiced and septic air was replaced with a fragrant breeze that seemed to latch onto his brain stem and pull up memories and experiences he’d never had, environments he’d never known. 

Long grasses and bright splatters of flowers came into focus, and he heard the sound of wind in the trees, and insects, and a stream sliding over stones.

The hexagon disappeared, and their feet touched the ground.
