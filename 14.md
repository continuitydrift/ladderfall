Eph didn't have anyone to blame for anything anymore. He floated in the nutrient bath, both his body and his consciousness, essentially, dissolving, down to the cortical stem, the core of the neural tree, roots and branches, that tightly wound coil of mortality.

They had asked if he wanted to be awake or not. Either way it would be painless. Eph had shrugged, and the surgeon had told him he could play it by ear, it would be as easy as turning a metaphorical knob.

So he had elected for both, checking in on what it felt like to be eyes and a brain in a jar, with loose, concentrically nested bags of jelly-fish like flesh being molecularly reconstituted. Nothing less would do. The programs infecting his bones had gone deep, meant as they were to be serving platters proferring his meat at rates accelerated growth, to the detriment of his own life span.

Ironically, the precursor ship was using him in the same way that his own people had meant to, only more completely. When Eph had been linked, telepathically, with Debria, Shin, and the grieving hive-mind of the drift-sands (heaving themselves up against the gravity of a sun and singularity by a single, cosmically-projected thread) he had asked it that question, the one he had been afraid to articulate, even to himself: *did you make me the way I am?*. He felt like a puzzle piece that, like Ladderfall, fit too snugly into place for coincidence, or even opportunism on the part of the sentient planet. Although, when every grain in a vast, world-enfolding sea is essentially a living ghost, when the precursors directed their intelligence to a task, opportunism could reach scales nearing omnipotence.

Even in their reduced, dismantled state, the precursors were able to reverse the curse of his genetic engineering, something doctors throughout the Expanse had been unable to accomplish.
