# 14: Halia

Eph didn't have anyone to blame for anything anymore. He floated in the nutrient bath, both his body and his consciousness, essentially, dissolving, down to the cortical stem, the core of the neural tree, roots and branches, that tightly wound coil of mortality.

They had asked if he wanted to be awake or not. Either way it would be painless. Eph had shrugged, and the surgeon had told him he could play it by ear, it would be as easy as turning a metaphorical knob.

So he had elected for both, checking in on what it felt like to be eyes and a brain in a jar, with loose, concentrically nested bags of jelly-fish like flesh being molecularly reconstituted. Nothing less would do. The programs infecting his bones had gone deep, meant as they were to be serving platters proferring his meat at rates accelerated growth, to the detriment of his own life span.

Ironically, the precursor ship was using him in the same way that his own people had meant to, only more completely. When Eph had been linked, telepathically, with Debria, Shin, and the grieving hive-mind of the drift-sands (heaving themselves up against the gravity of a sun and singularity by a single, cosmically-projected thread) he had asked it that question, the one he had been afraid to articulate, even to himself: *did you make me the way I am?*. He felt like a puzzle piece that, like Ladderfall, fit too snugly into place for coincidence, or even opportunism on the part of the sentient planet. Although, when every grain in a vast, world-enfolding sea is essentially a living ghost, when the precursors directed their intelligence to a task, opportunism could reach scales nearing omnipotence.

Even in their reduced, dismantled state, the precursors were able to reverse the curse of his genetic engineering, something doctors throughout the Expanse had been unable to accomplish. It was so he could survive the journey they were about to make, but underneath that reasoning, he knew there was something more: the ship needed what he carried in his flesh. His bones had been a courier, all this time, carrying the package of his blood and flesh, which for some obscure reason the drift sands had needed to complete their transformation, and go in search of a new home.

It was unclear whether it was the scientists in charge of the operation, with the help of technology they had discovered, or had been revealed to them in the obelisk vault, or if the swarm itself was somehow dissolving his cells and reconstituting the proteins and filaments of his body. It was an echo of the question of agency and free will that had been plaguing him ever since the symbiote had first manifested.

Halia Adler (callsign Farseer) had cornered/approached Eph in the hexagonal corridor etched in gold and black sigils, and asked if they could talk. She’d seemed indifferent in the meeting, lost in her own thoughts, barely listening to the scientists as they told Eph that he and Debria would have to fly down to where Ladderfall swung as one of the feet of the octopus-like skirt of the god-ship, after their bodies had been dissolved and reconstructed. 

She had grey hair, and a heavy frame which she moved gracefully despite signs of sore joints and age-weakened muscles. “I wanted to thank you for doing this. The doctors say that with your new body you won’t have to worry about radiation damage, but…it’s still going to be painful.”

“I know,” Eph said, awkwardly moving out of the way as another scientist moved past them. Halia had put her hand on his arm, to help him move out of the way, but it lingered there. “You’re used to pain, aren’t you?” She had asked. Eph stared at her, trying to figure out what she wanted. “Can I walk with you?” she had asked. He nodded.

“I don’t really have a choice, do I?” Eph had asked, once they were moving, their magnets in their heels clicking faintly against the metal. “About going down to Ladderfall, or letting the precursor swarm harvest whatever it is they brought here in my body.”

“What do you mean?” 

“Well, like everyone keeps reminding me, this ship is the archive of a billion sentient organisms, the ghost of a gaian biomass, the most dense form of information anywhere in the known universe. What kind of a person would I be if I didn’t do everything I could, with my stupid, insignificant life, to save it?” They passed a gallery of what looked like quartz crystals encasing ferns, quicksilver pools shimmering beneath them.

“What do you think Aegis is?” Halia had asked.

“Some kind of god-like Superorganism,” Eph answered. “I’ve…felt it. Been part of its mind.”

“How is that possible?”

“What do you mean? We shared a telepathic link.”

“Okay, sure, but any kind of a link would just be that: a link *to* something, not becoming the thing itself. Whatever conception of the precursor swarm you held in your mind would still have to be contained in your mind, which is limited to human cognitive capacity.”

“So it’s not God-like? It’s just some kind of a hallucination? Delusion?”

“All I’m saying is that a limited neurological system–and any system, by definition, will be limited–will perceive something larger and more entropically dense than itself as god-like. We’re unable to distinguish between orders of magnitude above our own domain, in the same way that a bacterium, or insect, couldn’t really distinguish between the surface of a fish, or a whale.

Eph had huffed, and the lights in the corridor had flickered, the floor shifting slightly underneath them. They were near the medical bay, and a group of doctors in gray, disposable uniforms were waiting to escort Eph into the operation room. Debria was also there, looking distractedly at a read-out film with pulsing blue script. 

Halia pulled him close. “Do you know why Debria came to Aegis, why she really wanted to see Magnus Shin? Why she would risk her life to get to the surface?”

“Because she…” Eph shook his head, realizing she’d never really told him. After the kiss, he’d just *felt* that he had understood, but she’d never actually told him. “...I saw into her mind.”

“I told you,” Halia had said, “you can only see, when linked with something else, whatever form of them can fit into your mind. You only saw what she wanted you to see.”

“Why, then?”

“The same reason I did, at first. To kill him.”

When Eph woke up in his new body, the same as that he’d already had, but smaller, healthier, and without the scars, Debria was sitting in the room, looking at the same film of read-out. She smiled and reached for his hand. “Hey.”

Eph stared  at her, trying to decide if what Halia had told him could be true. “We need to go now, don’t we?”

“Yeah,” Debria said. “They said that we’re passing through the line of syzygy. It’s the only chance they’ll have, and they need the door of Ladderfall closed, and us in there to pilot it.”

“You know what?” Eph asked. “I’m glad we’re not telepathic anymore.”

“Why?” Debria asked, confused.

“Because then I wouldn’t have the chance to trust you.”
