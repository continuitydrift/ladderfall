# 4: The Hook

"Are you sure about this?" Eph asked, and they approached the hook of the space elevator, Debria taking over the controls.

Things were happening quickly, and his mind was having trouble catching up to this new reality. Debria, on the other hand, seemed in her element, her eyes sparkling, speaking quickly, reassuring him that she knew what she was doing. As far as Eph could tell, she did. The drift pirate had opened up a hatch on the floor he didn't even know existed, unfolding and assembling a copilot chair, splitting the display shield into halves, downloading navigation algorithms from a port under the nail of her little finger.

*Her story checks out.* Eph's symbiote told him, the words appearing where the logs had been.

*She has one of you in her too, doesn't she?* In order to communicate with his parasite, all Eph had to do was visualize the words he wanted to say in his mind. He suspected that the precursor being knew his thoughts better than he himself did. It was like having conversations with his subconscious.

The space elevator, a mono-filament cable tied to the obelisk site on one end, the other a weighted anchor flung out in a wide centrifugal spin, which rendezvoused near Aegis once ever thirteen hours, which was the length of a Aegisian day. Ships could hook onto and slide down the thread of self-repairing, molecular smooth metal, accelerating to apex of the curve (the space-facing end traveling slightly faster than the length of the elevator itself) and using the corresponding slope of the arc for deceleration. Aegis had no atmosphere, and the coupling between the ship and cable was lubricated with an electromagnetic repulsion field, so no speed was lost to friction.

Visitors to the surface had less than seven hours to get underground before the landing site turned to face the sun, which baked the surface in unsurvivable heat and radiation. The differential of temperature was extreme enough that the sun-facing side of the planet actually bulged outward with heat expansion, causing the tidal waves of the drift sands.

There was, aside from those immediate constraints, the larger ticking clock of the black hole swallowing the meteor storm, spewing deadly (but weirdly beautiful) mutagenic flares. Debria had shown him images the pirate ship had taken of the event, incandescent, prismatic bridges from the realms of nothingness and death.

The solar year, the time it took for Aegis to orbit its sun, was only 34 of the planet's 13 hour days, which meant that in less than a week both Vera and the scientists on the surface could no longer count on the giant sun to protect them. For Aegis, every year had a "blue period" and a "red period", depending on whether the collapsing of space, and bending of the sun's light from the black hole, was in front of them or behind them. This season, according to Debria, in less than a week when the sky became blue-shifted, no biological life in the system could survive. The orbital, to shield itself from the sun, had to stay in the shadow of the planet, and this would mean exposing itself to the effects of huge chunks of interstellar matter collapsing into the singularity.

"The pirates didn't come to take control of the orbital" Debria had said, as they approached the elevator hook, "or to scavenge from it. We came here to save you."
