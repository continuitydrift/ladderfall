# 1: Vera

Vera had been taken over by pirates, again.

Eph didn't really care. The whole thing, despite the deadly stakes, had the appearance of bad theater, or fake wrestling. He'd only been on the orbital four months, and already the nominal control of the research station had changed hands twice, bloodless coups where the aggressors took over, noisily threatening to switch off some machinery vital to the orbital's survival.

This wasn't hard to do, since the research station, cowering behind a planet against solar winds, was always on the brink of catastrophic failure. This sector of space seemed imminently hostile to human life, always threatening a thousands gruesome deaths at the smallest misstep. Virtually *every* piece of equipment was vital to their survival, and would-be saboteurs found an embarrassment of riches in critical, unguarded systems. Outgoing administrations yielded to the usurpers with what seemed, to Eph, suspiciously like relief.

Drift pirates, in reality, were just entrepreneurial supply chain engineers, handling the dispositions of cargo and personnel, without job security or benefits. They had the freedom, as independent contractors, to deploy unconventional methods, like extortion and theft. Not that such tactics wouldn't be deployed by actual governments or mining interests, but pirates could be more open with their threats and negotiations. 

Once Vera was "captured," salvaging anything useful from the decrepit outpost would require vast logistical and technical coordination, which would be impossible if the pirates had come aboard lasers blazing, murdering the inhabitants. Complications of time dilation also meant that buyers outside the black hole's influence needed some assurance of stability to still be around once the caper was pulled off.

In the absence of any clear authority, rule in the sector reverted to an anarchy of swords, the wisdom of a crowd of lasers, with bureaucracy expressed as pseudo-military shuffling, largely devoid of violence since the battlefield itself was constantly trying to kill everyone, and actual combat would merely be a waste of resources.

Eph had turned off his coms, weary of the hyperbolic alerts about boarding parties and breached airlocks, and turned on some soft music, packing his few belongings and staring out the window at the enormous shield of Aegis, wreathed in penumbral tentacles of red-shifted light and radiation flares. The desert planet blocked out the sun, which in turn nearly covered the colorful vortex of the famous black hole. Each of the three astral objects, planet, sun, and singularity, were orders of magnitude larger and more distant than the one before, such that they appeared, in the window, almost exactly the same size, nestled in shared tenebrous outlines, like the cross-section of some off-gasing fruit. Layers of terror and fascination.

Even before the pirates, there had been news about a spate of interstellar debris about to get sucked into the black hole, sufficient to cause enough radiation to overwhelm Vera's shielding, and rumors that the research station would shut down. Such events had happened before. Unfortunately, because of the relativistic effects, each crisis, although passing quickly for the world itself, took millennia, from the perspective of the outside universe, to resolve. If he left, he would never have a chance to return.

Even before word of the upcoming radiation flare, Eph's application to visit the surface, to see Dr. Shin in the obelisk vault, had been denied, and the only reason Eph hadn't already left was because he hadn't figured out anywhere else to go.

Leaving would mean forsaking his vow, which he had sworn on iron, using the sword of his tribe, which he had stolen when he left, and traded for his ship. He'd promised the symbiote that he would show it the surface, the roiling sands of the grey memetic seas. The mind-parasite had been the only reason his application had even been considered, although half of the systems in the Forge didn't even recognize it as a life form, treating it instead as a rare, inexplicable psychosis.

The few friends he'd made since arriving in Terminus had warned him about Vera, the weirdness of the system that went beyond the celestial pyrotechnic lightshows. "It swallows lives and careers," his advisor had told him, "as surely as the black hole everything spins around swallows space and light. It used to be a cultural marvel, but now everything is just circling the drain, waiting for oblivion."

Part of the orbital's reputation was due to the time dilation caused by the gravity well, the deep, greedy dent in space time. Things moved slowly here, as seen from the outside. Research projects took forever, often outliving funding and interest from impatient observers beyond the reach of the slow-down.

For Eph, the idea that the universe beyond the black-hole shrouded system would pass by in a blur, everyone and everything he knew leaving him behind as a near-frozen artifact, wasn't a deterrent. He'd already abandoned his home, family, and friends, and the relativistic speeds he'd traveled to get to Terminus already meant his life up until now was consigned to a distant, unreachable past. He was barely twenty years old, but his tribe had been dead for thousands of years. All because he had been infected by a vestigal symbiote while racing with his friends in an asteroid belt.

It was a precursor virus, an artefactual afterthought of a bygone era, that had wanted to see the galaxy, and Eph was the only way for it to do so. It had wanted to see the memes on Aegis, and made him swear that they would touch the surface, and enter the vault. In return, it had refrained from driving him insane.

The memes, his advisor had told him, were the other part of the event horizon that swallowed promising research careers. They were a textbook case of an insoluble mystery. Not that they couldn't be explained. On the contrary, they seemed to invite conflicting hypotheses, as if designed to suggest an array of possible explanations, with tantalizing clues to some final proof or insight which proved ever out of reach. A vanishing horizon of immanent knowability, wrapped in a kind of mania, or fever. One of the theories, in fact, was that the memes of Aegis were a weaponized puzzle, to drain the cognitive abilities of sentient life, to keep nascent civilizations preoccupied, so they would never develop sufficiently to get into mischief.

Yet, despite its infectious allure, the popularity of Aegis and its research orbital had waned. The environment was too dangerous, and the project too wasteful, and unlikely to yield results. The amount of time squandered in the study of the sentient sands appeared worse because of the relativistic effects, as if scientists had been analyzing the weird landscape and vault *forever*. Which is why Eph, an untutored void-hopper carrying a mental parasite/unidentified psychosis, had been able to get lodging, such as it was, and a tentative interview with Dr. Shin, one of the more forward-thinking researchers on the surface.

The chime to Eph's rented quarters sounded, an occurrence rare enough there was a few seconds of delay as he processed what he was hearing, and another for him to maneuver past the zip-sacks and papers scattered on the floor.

The door slid open halfway, Eph pounding on it sideways with his palm to get it past the sticky point on the tracks, revealing a sharp-featured woman in her thirties, part of her head shaved, the rest of her hair flopping over one ear in unruly curls.

"Wow," she said. "This is one small room for...a big person." She was eying Eph's bulk in a way he was used to, not even bothering to hide her astonishment. Her teeth were straight when she smiled, but slightly stained with a shade of blue, like she'd been drinking berry juice or wine. He didn't recognize her accent, but her poise and posture distinguished her as someone either with rank or natural self-possession.

"I need to talk to you," she said.

"You couldn't send me a message on the Weave?" Eph asked.

"You had your coms turned off. I'm sorry, this is urgent." She looked around his room again, apparently judging the suitability of the size (and smell) for company.

"Shall we talk in the deck? I'll buy you a drink."
