# 12: The Obelisk

Eph stared up at the inside of the floating monolith, leaning his head back as much as his helmet would allow, washed in a pleasant vertigo. It was as if all the stars in the sky had been pulled close, captured in a pyramidal planetarium, their colors enhanced beyond what the human eye could normally see, as if the ideas of stars, of light, were being beamed directly to his mind. Each of these impossibly vibrant points was connected by attenuated, perfectly straight lines, shimmering with precise, abstract geometry, not symmetrical but suggestive of symmetry in higher, barely perceptible dimensions. The four walls of the structure were like some cosmic wizard's tent, opening into mirrored, kaleidoscopic depths, darker than the sky, more empty than the space between stars.

The symbiote had left again, hours ago, pulling themselves out of visible text and recorded voices, sinking into the sands to find someone, or something, it had called the gatekeeper. Since landing on the planet, the Vestige seemed to have gotten more cryptic than ever, blending with the text or speech they were replacing, struggling to translate from whatever language the planet was using to speak to itself. *I'm telling you everything I know*, the pseudoghost had said, *as clearly as I can.*

The ship, Ladderfall, really had been to those places in the logs. There were, stored in secret holds, minerals and compounds that the planet computer needed to survive the flare. Aegis was a machine, a living engine of information, running a universe. If the sand was fused into glass, if the entropy was disrupted, entire civilizations, billions of sentient beings, would perish, ceasing to exist. The galaxy encoded in the drift sands had been using Eidolon ships to collect what it needed from parallel realities, like blood cells pumped back into a heart. It had crashed the ship because it had needed to inject the medicine it contained beneath its surface, the skin of its outer layer.

The symbiote hadn't known any of this until the crash, yet it had been guided by the vault, like Eph and Debria had been controlled by the symbiotes inside of them. It was like a dream, suddenly remembered.

"We don't have much time left," Debria said, looking out at the horizon, which was beginning to glow with the impending enormity of the sun. If the symbiote didn't return soon, and somehow open the entrance to the vault, they would die in a blazing, radioactive sunrise. Not the worst way to go, Eph thought.

He was hungry, the nutrient pouch in his suit deflated, the water almost gone. He was sweating, the suit failing to compensate for the rising temperature. At least he got to see this, Eph thought. He'd met Debria. The symbiote had shown him her thoughts. They knew each other better, in a way, than humans who had been lovers for years.

Debria seemed less fascinated by the interior of the obelisk than him, looking instead out at the brightening surface, with its weird wisps of off-gassing and dust, like writhing tentacles of submerged, aquatic beasts.

"It's just like working for the pirates. You're always moving cargo, playing unwittingly into some conspiracy. Wheels within wheels. The conglomerates, the planetary councils, they're so opaque and distant, they might as well be aliens from another dimension."

"There has to be more than that," Eph said. "My colony, my tribe, they used my body to keep them healthy, knowing it would kill me. I thought I'd escaped, but...it's the same thing again, at a larger scale. Using me, the ship. We're being sacrificed. Lied to. My body, my whole existence, it's always just been *food* for something else. Since I met you I thought...it could mean something more."

"This isn't like the dream-shows used to keep people sane on long jumps" Debria said, "narcissistic fairy tales. We don't get to be heroes, saving the galaxy. We're just little grains of sand, you know, some calculation we'll never comprehend, because we're *part* of it. A packet of coded information, a synapse firing in some universal brain. Our lives don't matter. The best we can hope for is to see something beautiful before we die. And we have."

She reached out and took his glove in hers, knocking their helmets together, smiling behind the screen. "The sun's coming up. Let's watch it."

It took Eph a few seconds to realize what was happening. As the deadly globe of incandescence crested the smooth seas of drifting sands, shooting the waves through with a carnival of light, the sky somehow got darker. Eph looked up, and saw the obelisk, descending. Just as the horizon exploded with light, the alien megalith dropped down, nearly shaking them off their feet. Eph and Debria were encased in the obsidian dark, under the million points of color and the threads of light between them.

They could see well enough to make out the ground in front of them forming a funnel, like a sand trap, but with the grains somehow moving away from the bottom, rather than draining down into it. Claws emerged, then the thrashing body of a roc worm. In the center, beneath the quadrilateral claws and segmented arms, rather than the nine lidless eyes, was a human head.

"I'm Magnus Shin," it said. "Please, follow me."
