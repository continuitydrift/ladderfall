# Decoupling

"*Attention incoming vessel. Reverse course immediately. Landing at the research base is not authorized*."

Debria didn't react to the hail coming through the ship's systems. "Debria?" Eph asked. "Aren't you going to respond?"

"What?" the pirate said. "Sorry, I was hearing my symbiote. Whatever that was, it was pre-recorded. What did it say?"

"It said to reverse course, that we aren't..."

"*This station is closed due to immanent radiation surge. Do not attempt to land.*"

"Did you hear that?" Eph asked.

Debria blinked. "No. What was it?"

"They aren't letting anyone land. We have to go back into orbit. Is that even possible?"

"We could probably make it back to Aegis, but...my rider is saying we should just go ahead. It's some sort of automated system. We should be fine."

*They're right*, Eph's own symbiote wrote on the display, over the first few lines of a landing checklist. *Keep going*.

"Are you trying to kill us?" Eph asked, unsure if he was talking to Debria or his symbiote.

"Oh, fuck," Debria said, as the lents went from blue to red, like the season had suddenly shifted, the black hole in front of them rather than behind. "They just decoupled the..."

Her words were cut off as Ladderfall was thrown into an uncontrolled spin, rolling and flipping at the same time, the whip-like force of the released elevator cable flinging them off like a drop of water from a flicked fingertip. The straps dug deep into Eph's waist and shoulders, and he vomited, the liquid spraying in spirals around the cabin, giving evidence of the ship's revolutions. The stabalizers jolted and moaned, rocking them one way and then another, overwhelmed by the chaos of their trajectory. The gravity of the massive planet, along with their momentum, flung them towards the surface.

The ship finally stopped spinning, beginning to level out, just in time for them to see the shimering grey of the drift sands rising up to meet them.
