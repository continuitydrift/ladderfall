# 15: Compression

“Can I be honest with you?” Debria asked, as they used electro magnetic lassos to stay in one another’s orbit. Glowing ropes of drift-sands whipped around them, threatening to shear off their grapples and guides, little threads the suits were sending out to steady their fall. Everything was moving. The scientists in the piloting bay were also doing their best, Eph knew, not to bludgeon them to death while they tried to reach the Ladderfall and get the doors closed.

Eph grunted assent, focused more on avoiding chunks of debris sheared off the vault of the planet-ship. They were already, with their dance of tugs and altered trajectories–minute corrections in space as intimate as telepathy had been–trusting one another with their lives. The formality of verbal openness seemed to Eph redundant, almost absurd.

“I don’t think my symbiote showed you everything, when we were telepathic. The pirates wanted me to kill Dr. Shin. I was their assassin. I knew I would defect, though, if I could get away. I was never going to kill him.” One of the enormous tentacles of the gaia-ship, or sub-tentacle, a membranous cable, dim and stiff compared to the still-living threads of super-computing dust, arced overhead.

“It’s okay,” Eph said. He let one of his expandable grapples snag a bristled node of the towering column of living ship, sending another buoy out to Debria. It was a tricky maneuver, and the suits were only equipped to try it once.

<!-- this is where I made the face danger roll.-->

One of the drift sand tentacles torqued dangerously close, and when Eph tried to correct course by firing his right glove thruster, the glowing skein shifted, the helix tightening, and he passed through it.

The gaia-mind’s sensation of incomprehensible loss. In a prismatic, hallucinatory flash, time dilating to let in geologic weight, he smelled air tangy with oceans, the muck and swirl of biotic life, coastal trees lost in the clouds, red-knuckled mountains, still lakes and plains of wind-bent grasses. Then smoke, and heat, latticed, parasitic growths of concrete and steel.

“Eph!” Debria’s voice was in his helmet. A thick crack ran from the top of the visor. He could hear the sound of venting gas, and smell burnt wiring. He’d overshot Ladderfall, and was tumbling into the immense nothingness of the void. 

Debria was framed in the airlock, still in her suit. The grapple he had anchored on the ship trailed in front of him, ending in a snarl of twisted metal it had pulled free. Kicking, trying to pivot, he fired his main thruster, but the angle wasn’t right, and he ended up spinning, helpless and disoriented.

Then there was another jostling crunch, and he nearly passed out again. Debria had fired her own lasso, and was reeling him back into Ladderfall. “Thank you,” he said, his hands and face tingling. She was looking over his shoulder, her eyes wide, and turning, Eph saw it too: violet lines tracing a massive dodecahedron around the gaia-ship, sparks and signals flashing around the constellated pentagons. There was a noise from the helmet, a crashing wave of white noise. He watched Debria stumble to the controls and try to close the door, which groaned halfway, and stopped. 

The stars outside the grid of light started to stretch, and shift to blue. Both of them were thrown against the wall, crashing into the broken hydroponics. Eph, fighting against increasing gravity, turned to look at Debria who, behind her visor, was grinning at him. 

Everything grew very bright, and loud.
