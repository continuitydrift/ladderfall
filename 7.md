# 7: Sands

The drift sand started to pour through the door, until it stuck after a few finger widths, the last of the residual charge in the actuators depleted. Eph, one foot on the seat and the other balanced on the edge of the piloting console, reached for the crowbar fixed onto the wall.

Eph had woken up to what seemed to be Debria's head, floating in darkness. Laderfall's power was gone, and the auxilliary batteries hadn't come online, nor had the micro-nukes sprinkled in the hull as a tertiary fail-safe. The only visible light had been from the neck rings of their suits. Judging from gravity, the ship was inverted, nose up, tilted slightly to port. A faint smell of vomit and burnt circuitry had filled the air.

"We made it," Debria had said, after shaking him awake, a toothy grin replacing the look of concern he'd seen immediately after opening his eyes. Once they'd put their helmets on, the could use night-vision to see around the cabin, which had looked intact. Temperature and oxygen had been normal, and their clocks showed a time only a few minutes later that when they'd gone into free-fall. They hadn't been able to access the Weave, which, anywhere other than on Aegis, would have been unheard of, since the nodes--called spindles--used unbreakable, quantum entanglement. The surface of the planet was one of the only places in the galaxy where instant, omni-present communication was unreliable. Something about the proximity of the black hole and the sun, or the sands themselves causing interference.

Even stranger, neither Eph nor Debria had heard from their symbiotes. Written text and recorded audio remained stubbornly non-hallucinogenic.

Eph, beset by sudden claustrophobia, had tried the door, resulting in the drift-sand falling through the gap, and Debria telling him to wait.

"We should hurry," Eph said. "It won't be long before morning. We have to make it to the vault before then, or we'll be cooked."

"Slow down," Debria said. "Let's think for a minute." Her voice in his helmet was close, and soothing. She scooped up a handful of the drift sand from where it had fallen to her side of the cockpit, a wall that was now the floor. Eph looked down at her, between his feet. A hydroponic tube and fallen down, the radiation-absorbing succulents resting in small piles of soil-media and broken wires. "Think about how deep we must be in the sand. The nose is pointing up, so this is the highest part of the ship, and that door, on the side that would be closest to the surface, is completely covered. Everything else, below us, somehow got buried in the crash. The sands were somehow soft enough for us to sink, engines first, to be completely submerged."

Eph hesitated, thinking. "Or maybe we got covered in sand after we crashed? Some kind of dune?"

Debria shook her head. "We couldn't have been out for more than a few minutes. And there's no atmosphere, no wind. You know the surface, you saw it from the elevator. Except for the drift lines, its completely smooth."

Eph lowered the crowbar, climbing back into his chair. One of the panels on the wall flickered, then went dark. "So you think it will be too soft to walk on?"

"Maybe. We also don't know how far from the site we came down. We could be dozens of kilometers away." The infra-red filter on his helmet bathed everything in a pale blue, but from the corner of his eye, he thought he saw the sand luminescing, specks of light like single, malfunctioning pixels in the visor's display. He brought up some text, compulsively, to see if his symbiote was there: an ancient poem he used for that purpose. The archaic verse stubbornly remained uninfected by messages. "So, what do we do?"

"We wait," Debria said. "In another ten hours or so it will be night again, and we can try to dig ourselves out and make it to the obelisk."

Eph shook his head doubtfully, although Debria probably couldn't see it. "It's going to get too hot."

"The front of the ship is designed to withstand the heat of re-entry, with ceramic tiles and distributors. If we're as deep as I think we are, we should be okay. If we have to, we can go back into the cargo hold. It's better than flooding the ship with sand, and losing all the oxygen that isn't in our suits." There was a click as she took her helmet off again, illuminated once more by the glow of the guide-lights on the neck.

Sighing, Eph did the same. Without the visor, it was almost completely dark. He lay back in the seat, staring up at the dead displays. For a long time, neither of them spoke. He listened to the syncopation of their breath.

"You're studying to be a naturalist, right? That's why you wanted to come here, to meet Dr. Shin?"

"A memeticist," Eph said, "but yeah."

"Because the planet has something to do with your symbiote?"

"It seems to think so. My rider and and sands both seem to be at the edge of what people consider life. 'Emergent, self-organizing phenomena beyond the hosting substrate'. The virus in my head is smarter than I am. The seas of sand here express more information than they should."

Debria extended her chair out like a bed, and turned on her side to face him. "What do you know about the drift sands? Not the symbiote. You. What have you learned so far?"

Eph reclined his seat as well, but stayed on his back, looking at the slit in the door on the wall, which was now the ceiling, his eyes registering almost imperceptible sparkles of static. "It's the most entropically dense substance in the galaxy."

"What does that mean to you? What is entropy?"

"Information, I guess. No, not information. Surprise. Information you don't expect, but that follows from what came before. That fits." He tried to remember how his symbiote had explained it. "If a sequence of numbers is random, then there's no entropy, no significance. If there is a pattern, like a sequence of prime numbers, it has meaning, but once you detect the pattern, and can predict it, it ceases to be interesting. No more entropy. If the numbers are a language, for example, then they can have high entropy, but only up until the point where the message is decoded."

"So what about the drift sand?"

"All the tests are run, all the experiments, they return data that confirms the most interesting or surprising theories, right up until the point where the results are conclusive, until they return contradictions, suggesting novelty, some hidden twist or complication. As if the sand itself is leading the scientists on, playing tricks on them. Like the information is alive, responding to researcher's expectations, adapting to them, but without any kind of biological mind or physical organization. Just algorithms, memetics. An emergent principle balanced between being explicable, suggesting logical causality, and retreating into deeper variation, agonistic nonsense. An irrepressible impulse to be a source of speculation. That's why people think the planet must be somehow alive, trying to communicate, provoking endless interest." 

He picked up a pinch of sand and held it up between his fingers. "We could ask this bit of drift a thousand questions and get as many different answers, each of them suggesting a pattern, or unifying theory just beyond our reach. It's like that with my symbiote, too, as if its always hinting at what it really is, where it came from, but never telling me directly. Like it's doing everything it can to make me read more of its stupid, never-ending text." Eph wiped the sand off his gloves. "It doesn't matter. It's all academic."

"It's not," Debria said. "Not anymore. Say we could know the friction for one of these grains, their cohesion and weight per cubic meter, then we could calculate how deep we were by how much of it fell through the open door. Or if there was a consistent heat conductance, then we could infer the depth by comparing how hot this sand was to what we know the surface temperature will be. If scientists had been able to determine the viscosity of the surface we would know if we could walk to the station, or if we'll sink into it like quicksand. None of these things are determinable, because the answer, always, is precisely what will keep the researchers here, feeling like they don't yet know, but are about to make a discovery. My observations, my thoughts, had the same effect. Perfectly logical, but the end result was that...we're here. Trapped. This place is like a black hole, but one that consumes curiosity, imagination. The drift sand is, mathematically, precisely as mysteriously evocative as it is possible to be, and we're literally buried in it." She reached out and touched his shoulder in the dark. "It's terrifying, isn't it? But also beautiful."

They talked for hours, more, Eph trying to hold her interest, to be both forthcoming and enigmatic, wanting to keep her talking, asking him more questions. Eventually, he fell asleep.

When he woke up, the door was opening. Some of the ship's lights had flickered on, the colors unfamiliar. The chimes by the vent sounding distorted. He sucked in his breath, expecting the wall of sand to collapse down on them. It didn't. Instead, it kept its shape, as if held in place by some invisible force. Then it began to collapse, but *upward*, away from them, not in any direction gravity or logic would suggest. A tunnel formed, leading out into the sand, into the charged, electric dark.
